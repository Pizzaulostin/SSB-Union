# SSB Union
Track SSB fanfic connections  

If you see something missing tell me, I can't keep this thing up-to-date without your help

Current requirement to get a connection between stories:  
> Mention of an event/character/organization that originated in another story, characters that are related to each other or a direct crossover.  
The requirement is open to be tweaked but doesn't include use of fan species.  

Developed on Python 3.6.13 since that's what I had installed, will probably work on new versions too, or it might not. You can probably figure it out.  

Why am I even writing a Readme for this thing?
